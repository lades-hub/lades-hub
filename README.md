# LADES - Laboratory of Software Development

Welcome to the GitHub page of LADES (Laboratory of Software Development), a research group dedicated to advancing the field of mathematical modeling, simulation, optimization, inferences, analyzers, regulatory control, and advanced process control. Our mission is to provide robust support for the development of computer programs that facilitate these complex and critical processes.

## Our Focus

At LADES, we channel our efforts into three fundamental axes:

1. **Development of Mathematical Models:** We concentrate on the creation and refinement of mathematical models, ensuring their relevance and applicability to real-world scenarios.

2. **Control and Optimization Schemes:** Our work extends to the development and implementation of innovative process control and optimization strategies, aiming to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in various applications.

3. **Experimental Validation:** A significant portion of our research is dedicated to the experimental validation of mathematical models and control strategies. This crucial step ensures the reliability and accuracy of our solutions in practical settings.
